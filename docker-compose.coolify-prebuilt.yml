# Use this file if:
# 1. You've already built and pushed the image to a registry WITH code included
# 2. Coolify build is failing
# 3. You want faster deployments (no build step)
#
# IMPORTANT: The Dockerfile must COPY the code into the image during build.
# Code is baked into the image, so volume mounts are not needed for app/reverb/queue.
# Nginx configs are also baked into the image - everything runs in one container!
